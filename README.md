## Overview

Cat Wiki is a small project using the Cat API to create a wikipedia-like website about cats.

This project was pretty fun to create as I was able to use and learn NextJS for the first time. I can definitely see why NextJS is so popular as the static/server side rendering made the website feel way faster and smoother. Also, not having to setup webpack to shrink down the compiled javascript and having NextJS do that out of the box was very convenient. I used modular css this project (instead of Bootstrap or Tailwind) which forced me to learn BEM, Block Element Modifier. BEM is a popular css naming convention used to increase development speed, debugging, and implementing new features. BEM definitely helped speed up the development process of allowing me to name elements correctly and accurately so I could easily understand what was being styled/altered. 

In the end, I'm very happy with how Cat Wiki turned out. I might add some extra UX features like having certain cats that are displayed clickable links so the user can jump to that cat specific page with ease. I really recommend NextJS to anyone curious about it and definitely plan to use it more in future projects.

### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/f4NJ53rcfgrP6sBMD2jt) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.

## How To Use

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
